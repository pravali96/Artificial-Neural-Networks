# Prediciting Customer churn using Keras

Created an ANN model using Keras to predict customer churn. Data has 10,000 records. Experimented with various Kernel_initializers. He_uniform worked better with Relu activation function. Adding Drop out layers did not increase the accuracy further as the neural netowrk is shallow. The accuracy achieved on Train and Test sets are very close which implies that there is no high bias and high variance. Overall accuracy of the model is 86.25%.
